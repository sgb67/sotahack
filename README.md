# SoTA Hackathon: Micromodelling
Modelling biological systems is challenging, partly because models are often misspecified. It is important to have a robust approach to deal with this issue that is compatible with the inference process for these models (i.e., Bayesian Inference). In the notebook provided, there is a workflow of a simple inference task, a description of the optimal approach to deal with model misspecification using neural networks and a simple implementation which improves posteriors.
